# GoToDnSpy

## Introduction

Sometimes I need something command like Resharper has "Navigate To Decompiled Sources", but I don't want
buy and install it only for this command. So I created this plugin for quick access to dnSpy.

[dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/) is the best tool for .net reseacher.   
You can [download latest dnSpy build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/0xd4d/dnspy/branch/master/artifacts) from CI.
